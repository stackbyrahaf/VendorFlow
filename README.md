**Next Version In building this Project-->**

In this next Step we will build Cloud Vendor Information Service which will interact with the database(MySQL) and it will be also be exposing the Rest API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). 

**Now the Layer that will go in the Cloud Vendoe API Service.**

In cloud Vendor Information Service we will be building 3 Layers:-
1) Controller layer
2) Business/Service Layer
3) Database/ Repository Layer
in simple terms this is also called springboot project architecture.

Controller Layer will be interating with the REST Client with all the CRUD(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) operations. This REST Client will be the Postman or the Browser Window or any user interface application.
Controller layer will also be contacting with the Business/ Service layer and also be listeining to REST client and responding to it. Business Layer wil also be in touch with the controller layer and also with the Database layer to fetch the data. Database layer will be performing all the database related operations and with also be in connection with the DB.

Some part of this Controller layer is already build in the previous version but will be adding some more functionality to it.

**Added Exceptional handling features** for the situaltion like the vendor is not present. eg:- vendor is searched by ID via GET call and if no vendor is present then a proper message will be shown and the entire thing will be handled by the Excetion handling

**Added the Custome Response Feature instead of the Generic response** for the GET by id & GET all vendor details.

**Unit Testing with Junit + Mockito + AssertJ + H2 DataBase + SpringBoot Test Library**

Unit Test-> test all the smallest part of the program to ensure every part is working as expected. (& to get the code coverage)

**Junit** is the testing framework for java.(Developer side testing for code)

**AssertJ** is another java library .It provides a set of assertions mostly helpful in error messages.

**Mockito** is the mocking framework for Java. Helps write clean & simple API. Test are readable & creates clean verification errors.

**H2 DataBase** is the in-memory Database it s java-SQL in-mermory database. Its very fast and open source. Used in in-memory database.Springboot can auto configure embedded H2 Databases.

These all above comes with SpringBoot Application only we dont need to install it separately.

**@Mock** => by default respository layer calls service layer then the service layer will be interating with the DataBase so in order that the sevice do not interact with the DB data (because its a test call what ever value given is not for storing in to DB is only to test using the In-memory Database then after the test need to clean it)  so in the service layer test class we are using the @Mock. So we are mocking the complete Repository layer in out servive test class.

**@AutoCloseable** to close all the unwanted resources when the entire test case execution gets finished.
